Neural Network Project

Can create hidden layers with varying numbers of nodes. Learning rate can also be personalized. Contains two network tests, one for breast cancer data and one for identifying types of iris. K-Fold cross validation is also implemented but is not very useful for the breast cancer data set, as there are a prime number of inputs for the breast cancer set and the K-Fold attempts to make evenly sized sets. Uses backpropagation to update weight values.

Has not been tested with more than one hidden layer, learning-rates could still probably use some adjustment for smoother progression.
